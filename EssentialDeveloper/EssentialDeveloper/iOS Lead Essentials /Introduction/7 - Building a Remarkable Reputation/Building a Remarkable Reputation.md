#  Building a Remarkable Reputation

Many developers switch jobs via the typical path: a résumé. Odds are they get typical (average) results.

The critical problem is: your CV is likely to land on the desk of someone with no interest whatsoever in you or your work. If that’s the only path you take, you're missing enormous opportunities.

"Millions of resumes, all in a pile, all waiting for someone to find them. If you're in that pile, it's not a good place to be. Before you start looking for a job, consider what you could do today so you never have to worry about that" —Purple Cow by Seth Godin
On the path to an exceptional career, you need to stand out from the crowd. Otherwise, sooner or later, you’ll hit a cap.

What we’ve learned from networking with remarkable developers—with remarkable careers—is that they switch jobs fairly easy.

They often don't even have a CV. They don’t look for jobs. The jobs come to them through recommendations and their strong reputation.

You don’t need to get better at interviews and job-seeking. If you want always to get out-of-the-curve offers, your references should be your CV.

The secret to building such a reputation is what you do when you’re not looking for a job: over-deliver exceptional work with every opportunity. And make sure to make it known—share it! So you increase the chances of getting an even better project next time.

# Promote your work
Start a blog, podcast, daily advice, and/or YouTube channel if you don't have one already. Aim for one publication a week and increase as you can (the more, the better!).

"...you can be the best programmer in the world, but if you are sitting alone in your basement and no one knows it but you, it doesn’t really matter. You aren’t going to have much of an impact."—Sonmez, John. The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide
If you need inspiration, produce content about what you’re learning in the iOS Lead Essentials course. For example, create content about how your unique skills, your technical excellence, and leadership are positively affecting your outcomes, your peers, and companies you work for.

Sharing and teaching others is a great way to promote yourself, increase your visibility in the market, and help the dev community. Additionally, it will help you revisit and understand better what you’ve been learning throughout the course.

Add an easy way for people to find and contact you on your pages. If you produce good content consistently, you should eventually start receiving out-of-the-curve offers directly to your inbox.

These offers often can't be found in public listings, and are much higher than average.

Moreover, if you’re up to the challenge, writing a book and giving talks is a fantastic way to highlight yourself in the industry.

# Find a niche for your content
Everyone has a unique combination of skills. Make a list of ten ways your unique skill set can make you remarkable and appeal to businesses.

Focus on actual results you identify as unique in the work you do. The things that differentiate you from your peers. That's your initial niche and what you'll focus on for creating content.

For example, Mike combines finance, behavioral economics, and business expertise with technical excellence. Don’t go for typical, as typical has been taken already. You have to go where the competition has not. The further, the better!

Don’t be afraid of also sharing your struggles and mistakes as it can help others avoid them while giving you credibility. It shows you’ve tried things and can learn when they don’t work.

Remarkable people don’t fail: they either succeed or learn.

# Build your GitHub portfolio
Along with the course, build your GitHub portfolio to help you highlight yourself in the industry.

Most companies will Google your name before inviting you for an interview.

That’s a fantastic chance to start with a great first impression (first impression matters!). Along with your amazing online content (articles, posts, positive social media presence), they should find an outstanding GitHub profile showing how much you care for code integrity and empathy towards other developers.

GitHub provides an excellent opportunity to showcase your portfolio in a centralized and easily discoverable place. There you can demonstrate and promote the processes you use, metadata such as commit consistency (message/size/quality), code quality, communication skills, and frequency of your contributions (especially if you are interested in open-source projects).

Use open-source GitHub repositories to communicate your expertise.

Spend some time curating your GitHub repositories. Try to put yourself in the position of someone interested in learning more about you, your projects, and your skills.

Provide any documentation, diagrams, or code samples to communicate your intent well. Make it look good.

Highlight the purpose and techniques used to develop the project. This is a great opportunity to showcase any niched/specialized skills you have—the skills that make you stand out. (e.g., UI/UX, systems architecture, security, low-level coding, etc.).

Above all, remember that software development is a social activity.

So…

Most of the value you can provide comes from excellent communication.

For example, imagine if you had a Tic-Tac-Toe or FizzBuzz implementation in your GitHub repositories.

Although these exercises are simple, you can make your solution stand out from thousands of other repositories:

The way you segment your code into frequent commits with meaningful messages
A delightful and entertaining README (documentation)
An amazing user interface
Clean and easy to understand your code
A comprehensive test suite with clean and easy to understand tests
Demonstrating possible abstractions that contribute to the extensibility of the application
And so on.

Over-deliver in every interaction! With every opportunity. Even in small personal projects, over-deliver! Be consistent.

# Positively engage with others in the dev community
Engage in community discussions. Contribute. Help others thrive without expecting anything back. Go to events. Host your own events. Network.

Always be positive and find great things to say about other developers' work.

Sure some of the work may be lousy, but only looking for the negative just reaffirms what you already know and is bound to face resistance.

When you’re positive and listen to others, you know twice as much (what you know and what they know) and can influence and contribute much more to the community. Thus, the community will be eager to give back to you as well.

# It takes time
Remember the famous quote: “It may take years to become an overnight success.”

Well, it’s a famous quote because it’s true.

It takes time to build a reputation so, if you haven't started yet, you better start now.

Of course, some people can build a reputation fast, but that’s not typical (and many times unsustainable). So... It’s important to be realistic and set up the right expectations. Then, work towards your goals.

To build a strong reputation, you need consistency, patience, perseverance, and conviction.

Regardless of your current level, start building your reputation as soon as possible.

Beginners often believe they don’t have anything to offer. Everyone has something to offer.

If you’re a beginner and you share your journey, your content will connect with other beginners facing the same challenges (that’s A LOT of people). Your steps will help others thrive and show they’re not alone. It’ll also show companies and interviewers how much you care about your craft, journey, and assisting others in succeeding—immensely increasing your chances of landing a fantastic job.

Don’t forget to find your niche/specialization and share your step-by-step evolution.

Don’t you think that documenting your journey to master TDD, for example, would help others learn it as well?

Be sure there will be days you’ll feel like giving up. Don’t give up.

If you give up too soon like the majority, you probably won’t go far from average.

Set the right incentives around you. Write down your ambitious goals and continuously refer back to them when you feel like slacking off the path.

Remind yourself why you started this journey in the first place.

Additionally, be around positive people. People that give you the incentive and motivation to stay on the right path.

Be consistent, and you’ll be able to achieve anything you aspire to.
