# The Decisive Factors of Your Training

Many students want to know the decisive factors to become a remarkable iOS dev and experience an enriching and fulfilling career.

In our experience, it’s like learning how to swim vs. becoming an elite swimmer.

You can watch professionals swim all your life, but if you don't practice, you won't ever achieve their level. You may not even learn how to swim.

To achieve a high level of excellence, in any industry, you need to learn, practice, and execute. The more you follow these three steps, the more results you’ll get.

Your career progression is a result of how much effort you put in the right direction. The results you will achieve through this training are directly correlated to the amount and quality of your practice and execution.

The key to becoming a success sstory in the iOS Lead Essentials program is to learn a little bit with each lecture, and practice a little bit what you learned. Then, execute in your day-to-day work. Make a habit out of repeating this process over and over again.

One step at a time, in the right direction.

If you don't practice and execute what you learn in the lectures, chances are you won't achieve your goals.

If you don't fully get what’s in the lecture, don’t get discouraged. Open Xcode and practice what you saw. Even if you only copy and paste.

Build the project. Run the tests and watch them pass (or fail).

Feel the bits moving and get some of that feedback on the screen—that’s progress!

Done is better than perfect.

Some feedback is better than no feedback.

Any feedback is better than no feedback!

Don't wait until you feel confident you’ve mastered it, because it's very unlikely you'll learn how to execute just by watching.

The active practice is what will make you confident. Active practice will make you a master at your craft.

Don't wait for the perfect time (it will never come).

Practicing under imperfect conditions is what will help you evolve faster and achieve your most ambitious career and life goals.

Watch a lecture, learn, and practice a little bit. Then watch it again. And practice a little bit more.

Now... If we had to choose just one goal for you in the iOS Lead Essentials, it would be to execute.

You are learning so you can execute it.

You’re in the right direction if the following steps are part of your daily workflow:

- Learn
- Practice
- Execute
- Evaluate your results
- Ask questions
- Help others
- Repeat
- Small steps, in the right direction.

Keep this in mind:

- Your career is not a quick sprint (finite). It's a continuous journey (infinite).
- Your career is not about speed. It’s about being on the right path.
- Done is better than perfect.
- Learn a little bit and practice a little bit. Execute. Repeat.
