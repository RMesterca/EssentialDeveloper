#  Planning and Getting Things Done Effectively

Finding time to learn and practice is the key to achieve your goals, but it can be challenging when trying to manage family, work, fitness, relationships, and life in general.

There is a lot to juggle in a day, and everyone is bound to the same 24 hours constraint.

Why do some people find time to develop themselves, and others don’t?

Because...

“I don’t have time to do X” means “X is not a priority to me”

So… no excuses! If you want a better life and career, you need to make it a priority.

Then, work consistently and deliberately toward that goal.

If you want to make the most out of the iOS Lead Essentials and achieve a remarkable career, you need a plan to stay on the right path. You need to get things done!

There are plenty of planning strategies and tools you can choose from. If you’re already a productivity master, just stick with your working formula.

If you need some help planning your learning sessions, here are the essentials we use and recommend.

#1. Plan

“Failing to plan is planning to fail"—Benjamin Franklin

“A bad plan is better than no plan,” but you know what’s even better? A good plan.

A good plan is precise, realistic, and effective. Most importantly, one you can stick to.

Planning to study 12h/day 7-days/week is precise but likely unrealistic. It may sound great because of how much time dedicated to improving yourself; however, you probably won’t be able to stick to it for long.

If your plan is unrealistic, it won’t be effective.

It may work for short-term goals, like passing an exam or certification. But remember… your career is not a quick sprint (finite). It’s a continuous journey (infinite).

If you can’t sustain a plan for long, you may not achieve your most ambitious goals.

Going to the other extreme, planning to study ‘when you have some time off’ is realistic, but imprecise and very ineffective.

You can always stick to such a vague and loose plan because you don’t need to do anything to be on track. “Well, I didn’t study/practice today... because I didn’t have time. I’ll try again tomorrow...”

There’s no “try.” A plan is not a wish.

You need to allocate time for your training and do it. Otherwise, you may never find the time.

45 minutes a day is more than enough if you don't have a lot of time.

Planning is an ongoing process that keeps you focused on completing tasks and helps achieve your goals.

It should become a ritual to complete your plan every day. Nothing should get in the way. You won’t allow it.

To create a good plan to study and practice, do it at least the night before. Do it before checking your email, social media, etc. Perhaps, do it before switching on your computer, to avoid distractions. (emails we get are often somebody else’s planning/checklist they are trying to get through—they can wait.)

We recommend you to plan your entire week on Sundays.

Be ready, so you don't need to get ready.

The question to ask yourself should be “What would make this week a success?” Make a list with what you have come up with—those are your priorities. Time to make yourself more valuable (study and practice) is mandatory.

Look at the list and consider how much time you need to spend on each of them and break it into tasks. Check your calendar and add those tasks to your schedule. You may find that there is not enough time to schedule all your tasks. At this stage, reprioritize.

The secret to being productive is to have short—realistic—lists and finish all items. Every day.

Forcing yourself to have short and realistic daily lists gives you no choice but to prioritize.

Over time, the completed tasks compound, and you’ll have achieved—in the long run—much more than you could even imagine.

At times, you will need to break those tasks into smaller chunks, but as long as you complete them, you are doing well. Remember, your career is a continuous journey, not a quick sprint.

Ideally, the hardest and most demanding tasks should be completed first—there is great power in an optimal allocation of time. Take into account when during the day you are the most productive and your energy levels are high.

For example, some people prefer to study in the morning and workout in the afternoon. Others prefer to exercise in the morning, study during lunch break, and have the afternoon free. It's up to you.

So, throughout the day, don’t keep yourself busy with small tasks that are not a priority.

These small (and probably irrelevant) tasks will give you a false sense of accomplishment and suck out your time and energy. Get the big stuff done, then complete smaller tasks, one by one.

After tackling the hard stuff, you will feel empowered and ready to do the rest. Own your day!

# Decide on ‘When & How’

Make your plan complete with "when" and "how" for each of your tasks. Avoid vagueness.

If your goal is to finish reading a book and the plan is “Finish reading the book this week,” it will most likely be pushed to the bottom of the priority list as there is always something more urgent than reading, and after doing all the urgent stuff, you may just be too tired or out of time.

Imagine your plan is - “Read 25 min during the commute and 30 min at lunch.” That's 55 min of reading in your day! (Did you realize you have that time?)

If your home is busy and noisy with family, kids, pets, or neighbors who take your focus away as soon as you walk through the door, find a cafe or a library where you can finish your tasks without interruptions. 1 hour of deep focus can give more results than 4 hours of starting and stopping.

So remember - If you want to get something done, decide when and where you’re going to do it. Otherwise, take it off your list. Unplanned tasks quickly become noise, making you think you are busier than you actually are. So plan time to do what really matters.

# 2. Getting things done
So it’s Monday morning, the plan is in place. You are excited to have a super productive week. You take on the first task—the hardest one of the week.

You have been at it for 1 hour, and your mind starts to wonder.

“Oh this is hard, I hardly made any progress… I’m hungry… There are three more things to do today... Maybe a coffee would help…”

And although you’re getting tired and unmotivated, you keep going. Constantly checking the clock and dreaming about lunchtime (still 2 hours to go…).

A plan alone is not enough. Now you need to be productive.

There are ways to increase our attention span and be more productive.

The most effective technique we know to tackle ‘dwindling attention’ is the Pomodoro technique.

Set up a timer and focus for 25 min on a task. Then, have a 5 minutes break (set a timer!). Repeat.

During the break, walk around, make a cup of tea, stretch, have some nuts, do 50 squats… anything you want. When the 5 min is up, go back to work.

You can use the Pomodoro technique to finish any task that requires focus. Work, study, practice, programming, etc.

For example, if you perform 10 Pomodoro sessions a day at work, you’ll have produced 4h of deeply-focused work. This small and simple change can make you at least twice as productive as other developers around you. And… It works great in a pairing session too (tip: take the short break to share a cup of coffee with your pair and strengthen the relationship).

If you perform 2 Pomodoro sessions a day reading The Lead Developer Essentials book, you can finish it in a week. If you are consistent, you can read 40+ books a year!

When you embrace this method with discipline, your brain will remain focused for the entire session, and you won’t need to fight it when you start to get distracted. This increase in focus helps with problem-solving and increases productivity. Plus, the break time keeps you fresh and less tired.

Some people perform well with 25 min focus time; others can focus for 40 min.

Experiment with focus time and find out what works best for you, but do take short breaks.

Short breaks are essential.

Our brains work on the problem even when we are not consciously trying to solve it. That's why we often come up with solutions to hard problems in the shower or after we had some sleep.

When you are trying to learn or solve a problem, choose your break activity wisely. Don't give your brain more problems to solve: playing RPG or reading a detective novel will give your mind more to work on.

A break is a break. Rest your mind.

# 3. Review
Done for the day! Time to review:

What did you learn?

What did you accomplish?

Where did you get distracted?

Pat yourself on the back for all the tasks you have completed. Enjoy the control you have taken over your day. Check your plan for tomorrow. Can you improve it based on today's experience?

Remember that this is a tool to help you achieve your goals. It needs to work for you.

In the beginning, it is easy to write a schedule that is unrealistic to keep up with. That’s normal! But... you need to adjust it until you find a schedule that works for you.

Ticking off the checklist items is motivating and satisfying, but if you are unable to complete it, it has the opposite effect. It can leave you to feel overwhelmed and disheartened.

If this happens, rethink (adjust) your strategy and start fresh tomorrow.

You never lose when pursuing your dreams. You either win or you learn.

# No plan survives the battlefield
So... Plan for the unexpected meeting, sickness, friend in need, etc. Keep reviewing your plan, and don’t be afraid to change it. If you set up your priorities right, smaller things should rarely get in the way.
But… emergencies can happen. When it does, always go back to the list of priorities and reschedule your tasks.

Don't remove them, reschedule. Even better, allocate free time in your week for unexpected events.

Couldn’t keep your plan of reading 1h today? Read for 2h tomorrow.

Something unexpected for tomorrow? Do some of tomorrow’s tasks today.

Got some extra time today? Bring in more tasks (read more, study & practice more, workout more...).

Always be ahead of the game.

# Rest
Finally, allow yourself to rest and recharge. Look after your health. Have some fun. Build meaningful relationships...

Planning and managing your time is a life skill. Do it well, and you’ll achieve anything you aspire to.
