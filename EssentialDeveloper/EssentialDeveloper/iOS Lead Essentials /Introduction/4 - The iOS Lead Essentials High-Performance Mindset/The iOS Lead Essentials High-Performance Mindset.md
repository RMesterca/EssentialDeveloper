#  The iOS Lead Essentials High-Performance Mindset

What got you to your current career level, isn’t necessarily what will get you to the next level. It may even get in the way.

That's a hard realization for many iOS developers.

Many times in your life and career, you'll have to let go of the past to open space for what's next.

We know it can be hard to let go, but when you accept and embrace change and try new things, it’s liberating.

If you think about it... Embracing change and trying new things is what got you in iOS development in the first place.

However, the same steps that got you to your current career level can only get you so far. Repeating them will most probably generate the same results.

If you want to achieve the next level, you need a new path. A new set of steps. You need a force to generate motion—in the right direction.

Being open-minded will immensely boost your career progression.

But learning new ways is not enough. You need practice and execution!

To be effective, don’t focus only on the final destination (an enriching and fulfilling iOS career through technical excellence).
Chances are you’ve heard the proverb stating that a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. Well, that’s pretty accurate.

What the proverb doesn’t state is that you need to stay on the path and keep walking.

You can’t reach mile 1000 without walking 999 miles first. One step at a time.

So…

Your primary focus should be continuous improvement. Every time you learn and practice, you become better. And better... Step by step.

Learn, practice, and execute. Over and over. Focus on continuous evolution, and the improvements will compound.

In this process, we recommend you to evaluate yourself, ask questions, and help others continually. But we don’t recommend you to compare yourself to other developers.

Only compare yourself to who you were yesterday.

Ask the following:

"Am I better than I was yesterday?" Aim for a yes, every day.

Aim for 1% improvement every day.

One effective way our high-performance students adopted the iOS Lead Essentials methodology, was by watching and rewatching the lectures, going through the extra material, practicing, executing, asking questions, and helping others thrive. Over and over again.

It's like when you're learning a new language, let's say Portuguese. The more you hear it, not only you will understand it better, but also be able to use it better.

The more the iOS Lead Essentials practices become part of your daily dev routine, the easier it'll be to understand, apply and, of course, execute it and achieve your ambitious goals.

Remember: just watching is not enough.

You need to dedicate time for your career transformation. To reach the next level.

45 minutes a day is more than enough if you don't have a lot of time.

Watch a lecture. Take notes. Apply.

And don’t hesitate to ask for help and to help others in the community. We’re here to help you progress in the right direction.

Learn, practice, and execute.
