# The iOS Lead Essentials Structure

Many of you are super excited to start learning.
Others may be feeling overwhelmed thinking: "Will I be able to do it?" or "Will it work for me?"

The important thing is: whatever you're experiencing at this point is normal.
Be assured many devs feel just like you.

To get the most out of the iOS Lead Essentials course, it's important to understand the structure of the course before you dive into the lectures.

There are 5 modules:


# 1. Planning, Initial System Design and Requirements Analysis module

In the first module, you will learn the fundamentals of modular design and diagrams, and how they link with the overall business needs, planning, and requirement analysis.

The knowledge within this module is the foundation of everything to come. 
Being able not just to create good design, but—literally—visualize and communicate your intent with diagrams, stories, use cases, and clear requirements is essential to achieve technical excellence and collaborate well with others.

You'll also learn how to identify the common pitfalls of many iOS apps (e.g., Singletons and Spaghetti design) and learn the keys to short- and long-term growth, harmonious collaboration, and professional fulfillment (e.g., excellent communication, flexible design, positive mindset, leadership, career growth...).

The goal is for you to start off on the right foot, forming a solid foundation for you to stack the upcoming knowledge.

Throughout the lectures, we’ll be exercising the iOS Lead Essentials methodology, combining:

- Leadership as a Software Developer
- Requirement Analysis and Refinement
- Stories, Scenarios and Use Cases
- Effective Version Control with Git
- Modular Design and Clean iOS Architecture
- Design Principles applied in Swift (SOLID, CQS, Functional Core...)
- Design Patterns applied in Swift (Strategy, Delegate, Singleton Factories...)
- Unit, Integration, and End-to-End Testing Strategies
- XP, TDD, BDD and DDD practices
- Continuous Integration, Build and Deployment
- Economics of iOS app development (trade-offs, cost analysis, ROI…)
- Codebase Health Analysis



# 2. Networking module

In the Networking module, you'll start exercising the iOS Lead Essentials methodology hands-on. 
We'll cover Stories, Scenarios, Use Cases, Modular Design, SOLID principles, XP, TDD, BDD and DDD practices, URLSession, URLProtocol, Decodable, Unit, Integration and End-to-End testing, decoupling networking frameworks from business logic, setting up a Continuous Integration pipeline, how to work effectively with backend teams, and much more!

You'll keep learning the fundamentals with active practice and execution. You’ll learn networking best practices and how to tackle the most common challenges when it comes to developing, maintaining, and test-driving a clean networking layer in your iOS applications.



# 3. Persistence module

In the Persistence module, we dive deep into complex Stories, Scenarios, and Use Cases, Modular Design, SOLID principles, XP, TDD, BDD and DDD practices, decoupling database frameworks from business logic, Unit and Integration testing, URLCache, CoreData, FileManager, Codable, and much more.

You'll keep mastering the fundamentals with continuous practice and execution. You’ll learn persistence best practices and how to tackle the most common challenges when it comes to developing, maintaining, and test-driving a clean persistence layer in your iOS applications.



# 4. UI+Presentation module

In the UI section, you’ll learn about prototyping techniques, localization, pixel-perfect design specs, UX, UI, MVC, and how to work effectively with designers.

In the following Presentation section, you’ll learn about MVVM and MVP as we go the extra mile to decouple UI from core business logic, creating reusable UI elements.

You’ll learn UI, UX, and Presentation best practices and how to tackle the most common challenges when it comes to developing, maintaining, and test-driving a clean UI and Presentation layer in your iOS applications.



# 5. Main module
In the Main module, you'll learn how to compose all modules to form a fully functional app, validate high-level acceptance criteria with automated tests at every level (Unit, Integration, Snapshot, and UI tests), and how to set up a continuous delivery pipeline.

You'll learn app composition best practices, including how to use the Combine framework and how to tackle the most common challenges when it comes to developing, maintaining, and test-driving a clean Composition layer in your iOS applications.

# Extras
Throughout the course, you'll find a lot of supplementary material. 
The extra content is there for people who want to achieve extraordinary results.

For example, every video lecture comes with an accompanying article. Also, you'll find references, book titles, external links, recaps, mentoring sessions, and other bonus material.

Can I achieve my goals without the extra material?

Yes, you can. The extra material is not mandatory. But it vastly increases your chances of achieving results faster.

So, we strongly recommend you to take this extra content seriously.

Learn, practice, and execute. Be consistent, and the results will come.

Once you learn, you can't unlearn it. The positive results of your good education will pay off forever.
