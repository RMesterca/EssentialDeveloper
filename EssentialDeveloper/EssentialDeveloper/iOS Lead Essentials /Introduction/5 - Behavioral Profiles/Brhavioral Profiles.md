#  Behavioral Profiles

After working with and mentoring many iOS Developers, we observed and mapped common traits in the following three main behavioral profiles:

# 1. The Learner
The Learner, of course, loves to learn. Thus, the more they learn, the more they realize they have more to learn, creating a vicious circle.

For them, practice and execution are not that important, and they love to discuss the theory behind everything and how to develop high-quality solutions (for the long-term).

They avoid networking or pairing because they don’t like to code before they understand the problem thoroughly and have a solution mapped in their head. They often justify working alone by saying “I need time to think about the problem on my own.”

Learners are usually great teachers. When pairing with a learner, be open and ready to learn a lot (bring your notepad and write down notes and any book references or wisdom they might throw at you!).

# 2. The Networker
The Networker does not care much about learning, practicing, and executing. Instead, they focus more on establishing strong relationships with other developers.

Networkers go to a lot of events, they reach out to people, meet and make friends in the community. They often don’t care about the short- or long-term; instead, they care about now!

They love helping others, networking, and pairing. But most often will avoid taking the lead (they run from the keyboard!). They prefer to observe the process and contribute by exercising their connections and high-level ideas.

Do you know that problem you’ve been avoiding because you have to call support or collaborate with external teams? Networkers can solve these challenges in no time!

When pairing with a networker, they may not have the answers, but they know someone who does (be ready to meet and greet many people, help others, and increase your status in the company!).

# 3. The Doer
The Doer doesn't care much about how things actually work, they are more interested in executing and seeing results (often short-term). So they learn a little bit and spend A LOT of time executing. Even if the execution is not well-thought-out.

They are eager enough to start before they're ready! They often justify working alone by saying “people slow me down.” If they have the keyboard, it’s hard to take it back from them.

When pairing with a doer, you’ll learn how to get things done quick (be ready to try to follow their fast pace—they may not be able to explain well what they’re doing!).

# Finding out your profile
Of course, these types won’t ever describe you perfectly. However, it's important to understand which profile you identify the most (it may change over time!), so you can leverage your strong qualities, but also identify your potential weak points:
1. Learners may never get remarkable results if they just study the theory and avoid pairing with people that know how to execute. They need to reinforce the importance of execution and networking.

2. Networkers may never get remarkable results if they just observe and rarely take the lead. They need to reinforce the importance of learning, practicing, and executing.

3. Doers may never get remarkable results if they lack the theoretical foundation and avoid pairing with people that “slow them down” (they probably do need to slow down and build up the patience to progress faster in the long run). They need to reinforce the importance of learning and networking.

# Conclusion
All three types can achieve extraordinary results if they learn, practice, and execute.

However, Doers tend to achieve better (and faster) career transformations because they execute more!

Remember, you are learning to execute.

It doesn’t matter what you know. It matters what you do with what you know.

Execution is the end goal. But execution alone does not guarantee extraordinary results…

For example, if just driving a car made you a better driver, every seasoned taxi driver would be an extraordinary driver. Unfortunately, that’s clearly not the case.

Extraordinary results require deliberate learning, practice, and execution.

So above all, execute. But don’t forget to learn and practice as well!
