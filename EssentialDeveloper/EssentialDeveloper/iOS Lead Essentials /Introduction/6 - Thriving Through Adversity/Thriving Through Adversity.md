#  Thriving Through Adversity

In your journey of continuous improvement, you will inevitably face adversity, struggles, setbacks, hurdles, unexpected events, and enemy forces that will try to prevent you from achieving a remarkable career. We all face them.

The solution is to prepare yourself to overcome and thrive through all of them!

So…

We have compiled a list of the most common types of “progress enemies” and how to defeat them.

Overcoming these enemy forces will keep you on the right path to achieve all of your ambitious life goals.

# 1. Pursuit of Perfect
The pursuit of perfection is that voice telling you:

You're not ready yet to practice or execute it.
Learn a little bit more.
Don't ship it yet. Improve the code a little bit more.
Your code is not clean enough.
Don't apply for a better job yet. Study a little more...
This enemy masks itself as a good endeavor: to deliver perfect outcomes. In reality, it's just a natural fear of failure (insecurity) we all have. The pursuit of perfection is a place to hide from the uncomfortable.

“I’m not ready (perfect) yet” often means “I won’t fail if I never try.”

Don't let the Pursuit of Perfect win. Own your work!

Perfection is something we should all aspire to achieve; however, we should accept nothing is ever perfect.

Regardless of how excellent our skills are, there’s always room for improvement.

Our work can always be a little bit better.

But remember...

Done is better than perfect.

Improving one requirement is better than zero improved requirements.
Automating one task is better than zero automated tasks.
Decoupling one module is better than zero decoupled modules.
Writing one test is better than zero tests.
Applying for a better job is better than zero applications.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't aim for improving all requirements, automating the most tasks you can, decoupling most modules, testing all of your code, and getting ready for a better role.

Yes, you should aim high, but focus on continuous improvement to get there.

Small steps, in the right direction.

If you’re feeling like your results are not good enough, we can assure you that every successful software developer you admire went through this exact phase where you are now. All of them.

Results won't be remarkable at first.

For example, the first iPhone is much worse than the latest one. If Apple waited to release the perfect phone, they would never have released the iPhone in the first place. It can always be a little better—and in fact, it is getting better over time!

Although Apple aims to produce the perfect smartphone, they understand that done is better than perfect.

One imperfect execution today is better than a perfect execution a year from now. That’s because the “perfect execution a year from now” depends on “the imperfect execution today.”

So... learn, practice, execute, and improve continuously!

# 2. Time Eater
The time-eater is that voice telling you:

What's happening on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram?
Maybe you should watch another episode of [insert latest Netflix hit]...
Instead of studying as planned, let's eat something. You're hungry...
This voice will do everything it can to keep you occupied instead of contributing to your progression.

At the end of the day, you may feel like you did a lot of things. But almost nothing that gets you closer to your life goals. To where you aspire to be.

You may even feel bad because you didn't follow through with your plans.

So, every time you're fighting with the Time Eater voice, remind yourself: “I want better results in my life! And results depend on execution!”

Then go ahead and ask yourself: “What will get me closer to where I aspire to be?”

1. Occupying myself more with Netflix, social media, and other time eaters.

Or

2. Going through the lectures and extra material, practicing, executing, asking questions, and helping others thrive in the community?

Nothing wrong with entertaining yourself (we all need it!). However, you need to find time to improve too.

Small steps, in the right direction.

Plant seeds, create good habits, and be ready to harvest the rewards later.

# 3. Confusion
When you're confused, it's natural to stop and do nothing.

The voice will say: This is too much! I don't understand anything!

Confusion is natural. In fact, it’s the first step in learning.

But it shouldn't become an excuse for stopping.

When feeling confused, the first thing you need to understand is what is confusing you?

Is it a word you never heard before (e.g., polymorphism)?
Is it the application of a principle (e.g., dependency inversion)?
Is it a tool issue (e.g., running tests in Xcode)?
...

Then, write down a very specific question and send it to the community.

By asking questions, you can get unstuck and learn faster.

The more philosophical your question is, the more philosophical the answer will be. For example, "When should I use protocols?"

That’s a very broad question. It's not precise. Thus, you probably won't get a precise answer to help you out.

The more specific your question is, the more specific the answer will be. For example, "At 10:32, you say that to decouple high-level business logic from low-level details, we need to use Dependency Inversion. And that we can do it with protocols. How can I use protocols to achieve Dependency Inversion to separate my Login validation rules (high-level) from the Login UI (low-level)?"

Aim for specific.

# 4. Information Overloader
The Information Overloader is that voice telling you: "Oh no! There's so much to learn! I can't ever do it!"

Think about it this way...

Learning is like climbing a very tall mountain.

If you stare only at the top, it may look impossible to get there. Thus, the voice will tell you to give up before even starting. Instead, you should focus on the path right in front of you. The steps you can take now.

But the voice will try everything to prevent you from taking the most important steps: the first ones.

If you feel paralyzed at any point in the course because of the Information Overloader, remind yourself that everyone — EVERYONE — goes through the same challenges you're facing now.

And how do they win against the voice? By taking one step at a time, in the right direction.

The speed is not as important as the direction you're going.

Remember: You are in the exact same conditions as others (who got to where you aspire to be) were at some point.

Stay on the right path and ask for help when you feel overloaded with information.

# 5. Blame Outsourcer
The Blame Outsourcer is the voice blaming everything around you for your lack of results.

Usually, this voice wants to tell you that your environment and circumstances overpower you:

- I don't have time to study/practice because of X, Y, Z
- My boss doesn't let me write tests
- My peers don't care about modular design
- You don't understand, if you knew the company I work for you'd know it's impossible to do X, Y, Z
- Xcode is too slow/hard to configure
- And so on.

That annoying voice will tell you to outsource the blame to others.

The problem is: although the voice can make you feel better for a minute, it also makes you feel helpless. “Since my boss doesn’t allow me to write automated tests, there’s nothing I can do to learn and practice it...”

But... You can win the argument against the Blame Outsourcer!

For example, Caio once had a client that didn’t want him spending time writing tests because they thought it would take longer and it would cost them more.

Caio negotiated with his client to still write the tests, and if it took him longer, he would not charge them for any of the extra time.

They ended up delivering the project on time, and the automated tests were a great addition to the product development. Caio took responsibility for the outcomes, increased his skills and influence in the process, over-delivered to expectations, and acquired a client for life!

Take responsibility and outsmart the Blame Outsourcer!

Once you accept responsibility, you might feel bad when you don't get the desired outcomes, but the good news is that—since you’re responsible—you can still find a way to thrive!

The best opportunities come from taking responsibility when no one else will.

So every time something gets in the way of your goals, stop and think: “What can I do to achieve my goals regardless of the current situation?”

Regardless of your current level, the Blame Outsourcer will always be there whispering in your ears.

So... be ready to win the argument:

I'm a responsible person who achieves exceptional results, regardless of the situation.

The choice is yours.

# 6. Speed Comparator
In the iOS Lead Essentials, there are developers from all backgrounds and levels of experience.

And many developers tend to start comparing themselves to others.

They want to know who achieves more results, who earns the best salary, who finishes the course first, who asks the most questions, what is the level of the questions they ask, etc.

Comparing yourself to others can give you the drive to pursue better and faster outcomes, but can also demotivate you.

Because some people will get results faster than others...

The important thing is: speed doesn't matter.

Regardless of how good you are, there will always be people with better/higher/faster results.

When the voice tells you that "You won't ever be as good as that other developer—don't even try." IGNORE IT.

Be ready to tell this voice that you should only compare yourself with who you were yesterday.

Focus on continuous improvement. Tomorrow you should be better than you're today.

Aim for (at least) a 1% improvement every day.

One more lecture
One more practice
One more execution
One more question asked
One more dev helped
Otherwise...

If you compare yourself to others, you'll always find a way to lose.

Remember: You're here to achieve your goals.

You joined the iOS Lead Essentials program to become better than you already are.

Your transformation process is unique to you. Only you have control over how much energy you'll put into it.

One step at a time, in the right direction.

# Exercise
If you're not achieving your goals with your training, chances are it's because of one of these enemy voices in your head.

The first step to getting back on track is to identify which enemy voice is talking to you. Then, come back to this section, read the enemy description and how to overcome it.

You most probably know the enemies that often stop you from progressing in your endeavors.

As an exercise, be proactive and list the enemies you believe will most likely talk to you, and be ready to stop them!

1. Which enemies have already made an appearance in your life, preventing you from progressing in your career?

2. Which actions will you take to stop them?
